This repository demonstrates a common issue with Firebase initialization: unclear error messages when the configuration is incorrect.  The `firebaseBug.js` file shows how a missing or incorrect configuration value can lead to unexpected behavior without a clear indication of the problem.  The `firebaseSolution.js` provides a more robust solution.
